Synchronet External POTS Support v1.30
Plain Old Telephone System (dial-up) support
for Windows TCP/Socket/Telnet-based BBSes
(e.g. Synchronet-Win32). www.synchro.net

This repository contains a modified version
that can display a custom menu to callers,
and allow them to pick from a pre-defined
list of servers, which may be useful if you
run multiple BBSes and want to make them
all available via a single phone line.
